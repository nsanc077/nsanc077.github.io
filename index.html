        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Nathan Sanchez, a pre-medical student at the University of California - Riverside, with a deep commitment to healthcare outreach, mentorship, and community-based medicine. My passion for medicine is rooted from my experiences that I have been fortunate enough to pursue across hospitals, clinics, and nonprofit organizations. i am working toward a career where I can the underserved communities like the one that I came from.
        My clinical journey began with over 120 hours of volunteer work at a local community hospital. There, i gained exposure to frontline patient care and developed a strng understanding of the hospital's inner workings. From observing triage treatments in the Emergency Room to prepping birth carts in Labor & Delivery, I saw the daily challenges healthcare workers face. This experience helped solidify my goals to become a physician.
        In addition to hospital volunteering, I have had the privelage of shadowing a family medicine physician Dr. Ayon Martinez, a doctor who works closely with underserved populations. Through his mentorship, I saw patient consultations, diagnosis and treatment planning, and the interpersonal dynamics that define effective care. Dr. Martinez not only demonstrtes incredible skill, but he also has shown me how vital it is to listen, build trust, and advocate for your patients.<br><br>

       Outside of the clinical setting, I interned at ReachOut, a nonprofit focused on empowering the lower income communities across Riverside county. My internship involved outreach through public health education, mental wellness initatives, and youth development programs. This role helped me see healthcare not only as something that can happen in hospitals, but as a broader area that includes things like education, prevention and advocacy.
        I also served as a peer mentor for first-year CNAS students. Many of which were trying to navigate college for the first time in their families. I was able to provide guidance on time management, study strategies, and adjusting to the academic rigor of STEM majors. This role was rewarding and it reminded me how important it is to uplidt thoe coming after you, expecially in fields that arent always wecloming to students from nontraditional backgrounds.
        <br><br>

        Alongside these, I have consistently worked around 20 hours a week in my professional job as a student supervisor within UCR Dining services. This position allows me to work with student staff, create schedules, and handle day to day operations of a dining hall.
        Each of my experiences, from clinic to the communities, have shaped my vision on what kind of physician I want to become. I am driven to the belief that health is a human right and I am working every day to build the skills and knowledge I will need to deliver that.
